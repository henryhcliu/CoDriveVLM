## Abstract

In this work, we introduce CoDriveVLM, an innovative approach that leverages large multimodal models to facilitate cooperative driving among CAVs. By integrating bird's-eye view (BEV) images with language information, our system enables AI agents to reason about complex traffic scenarios and make dispatching decisions that optimize spatial relationships and minimize waiting times for passengers. We evaluate the proposed method not only on its ability to enhance traffic efficiency but also on its safety performance using a novel distance penalty metric. Our results demonstrate that CoDriveVLM outperforms existing methods by ensuring safe trajectories while effectively handling passenger requests in dynamic environments.
